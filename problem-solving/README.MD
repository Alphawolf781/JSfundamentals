### ALGORITHM DESIGN AND PROBLEM - SOLVING /  COMPUTATIONAL THINKING 

## Algorithm 
STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE TO SOLVING A SPECIFIC PROBLEM 
SERIES OF STEPS 

## CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ALGORITHM 
1. Finiteness : an algo. must have a finite numeber of steps and should terminate after the set the number 
2. Definite: The steps/actions to be performed should be very clear 
3. Input :  an algo. can have zero or more inputs. The input given is the data on which the algorithm will operate on 
4. Output : An algo. must produce an output. 
5. Effectiveness : the steps the taken should feasible within a reasonable amount of time 

### FIVE KEY PROCESSES IN DEVELOPING AN ALGO. 
1. Abstraction 
2. Decomposition 
3. Data Modelling 
4. Pattern Recognition 
5. Algorithmic Thinking 

#### Abstraction 
This simply involves filtering out information that is not necessary to solve a problem.  

#### Decomposition 
Breaking down problems into sub problems in order to explain our process more directly
This concept leads us to the concept of program modules and using procedures and functions.  

#### Data modelling 
analysing and organising our data : array and objects 

#### Pattern Recognition 
Identifying common patterns or common solutions to problems 

#### Algorithmic Thinking 
After observing all processes above we can now formulate our step by step process 

<!-- Expressing Algorithms  -->
When designing our algo's we express the solution using sequence of steps wittten in structured english or pseudocode 
We can also design a flowchart 

Four basic constructs 
1. Assignment : what are your variable references 
2. Sequence : What comes first 
3. Selections:  under what condition should a sequence be activated 
4. Repetition: a sequence of steps being performed a number of times : iteration / Looping
