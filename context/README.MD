### Defination 
In JS , context refers to the 'this' keyword which represents the object that is currently executing the code 

1. Global Context 
2. Function Context 
3. Method context 
4. Constructor context 
5. Arrow function context 
6. Explicit Binding

### Importance
1. Correct function behaviour 
2. OOP programming
3. Code reusability 
4. Scoping
5. Event handling : this will normally reference the element that triggered the event 
6. Dynamic Context : functions can dynamically have a setting on the execution context (bind, apply, call)
